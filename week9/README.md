What is the percentage of overlap? Compute this percentage in your code as a “Jaccard index”, which is defined as the intersection divided by the union: ((number of genes that were significant in steps 1 and 2) / (number of genes that were significant in steps 1 or 2)) * 100%.

number of genes that were significant in steps 1 and 2 = 6569
number of genes that were significant in steps 1 or 2 = 52073

The overlapping percentage = 6569/52073 * 100% = 12.6%
