1. In my stimulation,there are 51165 bases with 0 coverage and this is 5.1165% of the genome. 
2. The area under the normal distribution and the Poisson distribution shifted to the left. There are slight gap distance between the peaks of two distributions. Thus, the expected (mean) value for gene coverage is between 2 - 4, which is assumed to be low coverage. One reason could the high portion of the genes with zero coverage. 

Exercise#1.4
1. In the simulation, there are 56 bases with 0 coverage. This is 0.0056% of the genome. 
2. The area under the normal distribution and the Poisson distribution is better than 1.3, which in this case roughly located at 9, closer to the normal distribution value = 10. Smaller gap distance between the peaks of two distributions can be seen cmopared to 1.3.  Thus, the expected (mean) value for gene coverage is around 9. 


Exercise#1.5
1. In the simulation, there are 2 bases with 0 coverage.This is 0.0002% of the genome
2. The area under the normal distribution and the Poisson distribution is better than the two above, which in this case perfectly located at the center of a-xis, with the mean value = 10. Also both distribution almost overlaps with each other. Thus, the expected (mean) value for gene coverage is 30.

To accurately reconstruct the sequence, the assmebly needs to taking a large number of DNA reads (deep coverage), and the DNA reads should have relatively good qualities, such as overlapping between the reads, and using the appropriate and reliable sequencing methods as well.

Title: Exploring the Fascination of Genomics: A Journey into the Code of Life

Introduction

Genomics, the study of an organism's complete set of genes, their functions, and interactions, is a field that has captivated my intellectual curiosity for several compelling reasons. This essay delves into the multifaceted aspects of genomics that have piqued my interest, drawing upon the works of esteemed researchers in the field.

Understanding the Blueprint of Life

Genomics is often described as the blueprint of life, containing the instructions for building and maintaining all living organisms. The ability to unravel this intricate code of DNA sequences has profound implications for biology, medicine, and our understanding of the natural world. As Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, states in his book "The Language of Life: DNA and the Revolution in Personalized Medicine," genomics has the potential to revolutionize medicine by enabling personalized treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup.

Genomics in Disease Understanding and Treatment

One of the most compelling aspects of genomics is its pivotal role in advancing our understanding of human health and disease. In the seminal work "Genomic Medicine: Principles and Practice" by Huntington F. Willard and Geoffrey S. Ginsburg, the authors discuss how genomics has transformed medicine. By identifying genetic variations associated with diseases, genomics has opened doors to targeted therapies, early diagnosis, and the development of precision medicine. This holds the promise of more effective treatments with fewer side effects.

The Genomic Revolution

The rapid progress in genomics over the past few decades has been nothing short of revolutionary. Eric Lander, in his article "Initial Sequencing and Analysis of the Human Genome," published in the journal Nature, discusses the monumental Human Genome Project, which successfully mapped the entire human genome. This landmark achievement has not only expanded our knowledge of human genetics but has also spurred innovations in technology and bioinformatics, making genomic research more accessible and affordable.

Unraveling Evolutionary Mysteries

Genomics also provides a unique window into the evolutionary history of life on Earth. In the book "The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution" by Richard Dawkins, the author explores how genomics has allowed scientists to trace the evolutionary relationships between species and uncover the common ancestry of all life forms. This interconnectedness of life, as revealed through genomics, underscores the beauty and complexity of the natural world.

Ethical and Societal Implications

The power of genomics brings with it ethical and societal considerations. In "The Genomic Revolution: Unveiling the Unity of Life," J. Craig Venter discusses the ethical dilemmas surrounding genetic engineering and the potential misuse of genomic information. Understanding the ethical implications of genomics is crucial as we navigate the uncharted waters of genetic manipulation and privacy concerns.

Conclusion

Genomics, with its profound impact on medicine, biology, evolution, and ethics, represents an area of immense fascination for me. The potential to decode the blueprint of life, unravel the mysteries of disease, and explore the interconnectedness of all living organisms has the capacity to reshape our world. As I embark on my journey into the field of genomics, I am inspired by the words of Carl Sagan, who in his book "Cosmos" said, "We are made of star-stuff, contemplating the stars." Genomics allows us to contemplate the stars of life itself, and it is this contemplation that fuels my passion for this remarkable field.

Exercise#3.2 
I think overall the essay makes sense and the used citations are relatively reasonable and somehow convincing as well, which surprised me. Interstingly, I googled all the references it cited, and they all existed. There are some words that I don't even usually use in my writing, such as "interconnectedness".
