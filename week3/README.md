Step1.5

For amino acid sequences: 

The number of the gaps in sequence 1 = 9 
The number of the gaps in sequence 2 = 0 

The score of the alignment for the amino acid sequence = 

For the DNA sequences: 

The number of the gaps in the sequence 1 = 46 
The number of the gaps in the sequence 1 = 77

The score of the alignment for the DNA sequence = 3801.0
The score of the alignment for the amino acid sequence = 266300.0
